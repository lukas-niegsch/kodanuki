Kodanuki
========

This repository contains the kodanuki game engine and my upcoming game with
the same name. It is simply a toy project to learn more about game engine's.
Currently the kodanuki engine is primarily developed for GNU/Linux using C++.
Run 'make help' to view how to build this software and the documentation.
